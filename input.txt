         </p>
         <p>
          Before you send your resume, please read the following (numbered paragraphs below). We want to make certain that you have a further idea of what this job involves and what it requires. The following information is meant to provide insight regarding some conditions and environments that some people choose not to work with. We would rather have you know some of the specifics now, rather than later.
         </p>
         <p>
          1. We are very concerned about the health and welfare of all employees and make safety the top priority. Therefore, we are only interested in hiring conscientious, safety minded people who take good care of themselves, including good personal hygiene (persons exhibiting long hair, excessive facial hair, excessive piercings and excessive visible tattoos may not be hired or may be asked to cover up certain areas). Conscientiousness also includes always paying attention to what's going on around you so that pesticide applications are safe to our clients and the general public. Employees must refrain from the use of drugs and excessive use of alcohol. Non-tobacco users are preferred, as tobacco use is not allowed in company vehicles or on client properties.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. Exceeding our clients' expectations is our goal in all the services we provide. Therefore, all technicians must be service minded and feel rewarded by helping people and putting clients first. They're required to establish good working relationships with clients, including reporting important issues to them regarding their homes or businesses and showing care and empathy while performing their service. They must be willing to "go the extra mile" toward exceeding client expectations, all while displaying a professional and positive attitude.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. Employees must have reliable transportation to and from work and must have a good driving record. All potential candidate driving records and background history will be checked. No one should have more than two minor moving infractions in the past three years, especially if they're less than 25 years of age. In addition, there is a lot of driving involved since we have expanded our service areas. Some technicians will drive a company vehicle an average of 50 to 100 miles per day (on some days, even more).
         </p>
         <p>
          4. Pest control technicians regularly deal with ladders, spray equipment, and a wide variety of pesticides. They deal with many different types of insects and animals that infest buildings and landscapes, including but not limited to: bed bugs, fleas, spiders, wasps, yellowjackets, rats and mice. If you have fears about encounters with anything mentioned above or anything that is considered a pest in our industry (including killing them), then this job is not for you.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. A majority of the time, technicians are required to work over 40 hours per week. At certain times, they are also required to work on a Saturday, Sunday, after normal business hours and at night for commercial accounts. Overtime is paid at 1-1/2 times normal hourly pay.
         </p>
         <p>
          6. Pest control technicians must routinely enter spaces within buildings that pests travel through or live in. These areas (such as attics or crawl spaces underneath a building) can be tight, narrow, cramped, hot, cold, wet, dirty, dark, stinky and just plain unpleasant. Although personal protective equipment is provided, some people still find it hard to work in these conditions. For example, if you have fear of heights, claustrophobia, a bad back, or your physical size does not permit entry into a small space, you would not be able to perform this job.
         </p>

           7. We are a drug-free company (this includes marijuana use and abuse of prescription drugs). No applicant becomes an employee until they undergo a pre-employment drug screen, even if promised a position. Employees are subject to random drug testing throughout their career.

          We are looking for a professional, reliable and highly motivated teaching assistant to work within the classroom to support our daughter who is 7.
         </p>
         <p>
          She is a bright, happy &amp; motivated little girl who was born at 29 weeks. She had a very, very rocky start to life &amp; as a result she is now playing physical 'catch up'. She is delayed with her motor skills &amp; has low vision which means that in order to be able to access much of the content; adaptions or material creation needs to happen &amp; extra time needs to be taken for tasks such as writing.
         </p>
         <p>
          You will be partnering with the class teacher &amp; facilitating any adaptations within the wider teaching team to ensure that our daughter can be fully integrated into each lesson &amp; that all material is accessible. You will be sat alongside her, assisting where necessary; with the overall objective of developing her independent learning skills.
         </p>
         <p>
          The school is a main stream private school based in Bellevue. It is a wonderful environment &amp; the children experience a fantastic range of lessons throughout the week, which they often transition from class to class to.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ideal candidate will have a proven track record of helping develop a child on a one to one basis, have had some experience of working with additional physical needs, work well within a team, have lots of creative ideas to bring to the table alongside the motivation to implement them!
         </p>
         <p>
          We are only looking for candidates who are happy to put in a hundred per cent effort, genuinely love making a difference and someone who has got the dedication to help develop over the long term.
         </p>
         <p>
          An interest in developing skills, teaching experience, patience, creativity, great communication, team work and first language English is a must. Imagine It!, Any experience of Saxon Math, Social Studies Alive, and FOSS kits would be helpful but not essential.
         </p>
         <p>
          Guide hours are 8.30am  2.30pm Monday to Friday, although there is some flexibility with this.
         </p>
         <p>
          Very good $ package; car available for right candidate if needed.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you would genuinely love to make a difference, &amp; to be part of a team that is helping not let a difficult start affect a future; (and have the following), we'd love to hear from you:
          <br/>
          *English as 1st language or completely fluent.
          <br/>

          <li>
           The Assistant Supervisor is responsible for maintaining accurate systems of attendance within the swim lesson program in collaboration with the programs office, locating missing students, and contacting parents/ASP if attendance issues arise. Should an instructor miss a lesson, the Coordinator would arrange make-up lessons with families.
          </li>
          <li>
           In a multi-departmental structure, the Assistant Supervisor will need to collaborate closely with the ASP counselors to ensure timely lesson arrivals, changing/transitioning students, safety of the participants, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Assistant Supervisors leadership includes oversight of safety-related issues and disaster response within the program in coordination with the Director of Programs. In the event of an emergency situation and/or disaster, all staff are expected to remain present on campus to ensure the complete safety of all participants until no longer needed.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Program Coordinator will manage all assessment of student swim level and ensure that placement in groups/instructors is appropriate and best suited for maximum learning.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Coordinator will manage the flow of students and ensuring that they arrive on time and receive their entire 30 minute lesson.
          </li>

           Depending on enrollment and availability, the Coordinator will also be responsible for swim lesson instruction.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>

          Since 2007, Solar Universe has led the Solar Franchise industry and acquired the pioneer of the Solar Utility industry (Gen110) in September of 2013. With the sales and marketing expertise from Gen110 and the Solar Universe network, we teamed up to create the first solar company that integrates solar energy and home automation.
          <b>
           We have paved the way for zero-down solar programs and now we are paving the way for smart power and smarter homes.
          </b>
          We are passionate about renewable energy and determined to convert every home in America to onsite electricity. We help our homeowners unplug their dependence on expensive utilitys and give them the tools to live in a more comfortable, safer, and smarter home.
         </p>
         <p>
          Forbes Magazine recently described Solar Universe as: Silicon Valley meets clean tech, with the consumer in mind.

          In the 1920's, America fell in love with the automobile.

         <p>
          The Yleana Leadership Academy is a residential summer academy for high school students preparing for the SAT. Students (all of whom qualify for free or reduced lunch, most of whom are first-generation) attend on full scholarship and, besides studying for the SAT, study entrepreneurship (which culminates in a one-day startup fair with real live entrepreneurs) and discuss issues that will come to affect them as they enter The Rest Of Their Lives (intended caps) through the writings of authors such as bell hooks, Sherman Alexie, Junot Diaz, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Richard Wright, etc, while becoming a part of a welcoming and introspective camp community. One of the greatest compliments we received last year was a student who had been in foster care and had had trouble with her parents telling us that Yleana was the first place she felt safe, like people really cared about her. We strive to create and promote that atmosphere - a loving place for kids who haven't always had it easy.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2015, our average score improvement in a 3-week period was 250 points on the SAT. Besides just raising our kids' SAT scores, we also ensure that they have the one-on-one financial aid follow-up that they need in order to apply those SAT scores to the schools that would meet both their financial and academic needs, and we are currently working on the institution of a mentoring program which would track the kids throughout their college career, hopefully helping them stay in school and graduate. To learn more about us, check out our promotional video (which gives the look and feel of an Yleana experience): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzrQKbI37jg
         </p>
         <p>
          We are seeking teachers who are willing to follow the Yleana strategic approach to the SAT (some training will be provided; students already have materials, and teachers will be provided materials as well). Teachers should have significant SAT teaching experience as well as familiarity with the specific classroom management challenges of working in an after-school urban setting.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dates of employ will be
          <b>
           September 12, 19, and 26, 2015 from 9:30am-4:30pm
          </b>
          . Teachers will administer tests/portions of a test as well as teaching. On those days when teachers administer tests/portions of a test, they will be responsible for scanning students' answer sheets and uploading them to a scoring DB, and then printing them and distributing them in the next class, after they are scored.
          <br/>
          THIS IS A SHORT-TERM COMMITMENT, but with the possibility of future work (Yleana is always seeking teachers in a variety of settings). We are looking for creative, engaging, exciting individuals who are willing to take the lead in making learning happen, while still sticking to the strategies that the kids have learned. It is EXTREMELY important to us that you honor the way kids have already learned to take the test and the strategies they know.
         </p>

          We are a diverse camp and are actively recruiting a diverse staff.

           OUR OPPORTUNITY
          </b>
          <br/>
          Facility Coordinators play key roles in our organization. They are in charge of knowing the schedule and readying the treatment area and equipment before patients even arrive, so no one ever has to wait. They ensure no one is ever left alone, and that everyone has a friendly person to keep them company (plus offer snacks and coffee!) to everyone who walks into the office a level of world-class, personalized customer service they wont find elsewhere. They ensure our patients begin and end their sessions with smiles on their faces. Our Facility Coordinators also maintain the clinic and organize our supplies to create a very smooth workflow for all departments. They also act as the conduits of communication between our different departments and between the patients and team when needed.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a fun, lively opportunity for people who love to be up and active and not stuck behind a desk. You must be positive, organized, professional, and genuinely enjoy helping people and serving others.
         </p>
         <p>
          At a higher level, leaders in this position will focus on leading communication, continual innovation and development, training others, and will take an active role in growing our business.
         </p>

          <b>
           OUR CULTURE
          </b>
          <br/>
          Our company was founded on the philosophy that helping people and treating them like people (not like injuries) is the most fulfilling and rewarding thing to do -- and its the right thing to do. Thats why we spend more time getting to know our patients than any other practice in the area.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a result our patients feel more comfortable with each step of their recovery, and often they actually feel better faster as a result of having so much direct care by our Doctors. Feeling positive is a very powerful thing, and when combined with true professionalism and Doctoral expertise, its unstoppable.
         </p>

           GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

          This opportunity is geared toward people who want to stay and grow their careers right here in the company! Long-term applicants only, please. All opportunities are self-directed -- internally motivated people will do well here.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our current Facility Managers at each office, our Organizational Facility Manager (who runs this department for the whole company), our Training Managers, Supply Manager, and others such as our Reimbursement and Organizational Admin managers all started as Facility Coordinators. Additionally, the companys Executive Team is open to people in every position. You can create a career within the organization any way you choose.

           COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
          </b>
          <br/>
          Pay starts at $13/hour with the opportunity to grow from there. We also offer an above-and-beyond benefit package (effective at 90 days) that is better than whats offered by companies much larger and more famous than ours.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have an awesome three-day full time schedule. One team works Mon/Weds/Fri, and the other team works Tues/Thurs/Sat. And yes, this means you get the other 4 days off! We're open 7:45am-9:30pm Monday through Friday, and 7:15am-6:30pm on Saturdays. Team placement depends upon where we need someone the most once we find the right person for the job.

           Who We Are
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          A boutique academic and test preparation tutoring center based in Burlingame, CA, New Coda navigate students through the educational landscape at both the micro and macro level. Whether students bring a short-term research and writing project or need long-term guidance negotiating the standardized test timetable, we are here to help.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Philosophy
          </i>
          <br/>
          Before tutors can effectively connect students with content, tutors must connect with the students. At New Coda, all sessions meet student goals based on each student's personality and learning style. Unlike larger, corporate tutoring chains, New Coda is not limited by standardized approaches to learning; decisions pertinent to content and methodology are made individually to best serve the student.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Culture
          </i>
          <br/>
          It wasnt so long ago that tutors at New Coda were students themselves. Our tutors have a natural love of learning and are inspired to pass this passion on with energy and enthusiasm. Tutors have access to New Codas library, and they are encouraged to supplement these materials with content that excites their own interests and animates their sessions. We are flexible, collaborative, and value an innovative spirit. When tutors have the freedom to tailor lessons to the student and can incorporate stimulating content, learning evolves from simple instruction to an experience of collaborative scholarship.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Challenges
          </i>
          <br/>
          New Coda is a small-scale tutoring center with a sizable and expanding client base. With our focus fixated on student learning, we must explore how to continue to improve our service to existing students while also sharing our experience and expertise with a wider audience.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Goals
          </i>
          <br/>
          To better share best practices and reach more students, New Coda is expanding our talent pool, developing relevant and engaging curricular content, and reaching out to new clients.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Our Tutors
          </i>
          <br/>
          We are not the brilliant yet curmudgeonly intellectuals steeped too deeply in the old ways of academia. Our tutors are the heart of New Codas operations; their enthusiasm and talent make our modest tutoring center mighty, and they are valued for their experience, expertise, zeal, and dedication to their craft. Tutoring is an art, and true artistry is rare.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Qualifications
          </b>
          <br/>
          We are seeking specialty tutors for ongoing test preparation and academic sessions with high school students.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>
           Specialities:
          </i>
          <br/>
          English (Grammar, Writing, Literary Analysis)
          <br/>
          Social Studies (US and World History, Economics, American Government)
          <br/>
          Mathematics (Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus)
          <br/>
          Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Environmental Science)
         </p>
         <p>
          The test preparation component (SAT, ACT, SAT II) is paramount; most of our students first seek this service, then some continue with academic sessions. Experience working with test prep materials is ideal, but not required. Our tutors are willing to research and master new content as well as work within their specialty (or specialties!). Our tutors primary concern is to connect with students and make the learning experience a positive social experience, both relevant and productive to the students test preparation and academic needs.
         </p>
         <p>
          New tutors would begin with a trial period, working with one or two students, and then gradually add more students based on the tutors expertise and our students needs. Ultimately, a successful tutor at New Coda would work with up to twenty students per week.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rates depend on experience.
         </p>
         <p>
          New Coda works with students in our Burlingame location, and tutors are also expected to travel to students' locations as needed. Our service area includes the peninsula: Millbrae down through Los Gatos. Tutors must provide reliable transportation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our tutors a have excellent communication and time management skills.
         </p>
         <p>
          Interested applicants should send a resume and cover letter, including references and a brief (1-2 page) explanation of your tutoring philosophy.

          Are you the person that people trust to stay calm and collected during an emergency? If so, this tendency can earn you a full-time income, benefits and bonuses. Sonitrol Pacific is looking for people with cool heads, sharp minds, fast fingers and an eye for detail to join our great team of alarm monitoring operators.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unlike other monitoring stations you may be familiar with, this is not a huge call center environment. You'll have fewer accounts to monitor and will be able to make decisions that keep people safe.
         </p>
         <p>
          Successful Sonitrol Pacific monitoring operators:
         </p>
         <p>
          - exercise judgment, use discretion, and make decisions on their own initiative
         </p>
         <p>
          - communicate effectively with customers and teammates
         </p>
         <p>
          - have flexibility to work all shifts (day, swing and grave)
         </p>
         <p>
          - pass a drug test and background check
         </p>
         <p>
          - deliver excellent follow up
         </p>
         <p>
          - are organized and excellent with time management
         </p>
         <p>
          - focus on solutions in technical environments and are comfortable using a computer
         </p>
         <p>
          - type 30+ words per minute, know 10-key by touch, have multi-line phone system experience
         </p>
         <p>
          - have a HS Diploma or equivalent
         </p>
         <p>
          Our operators' expertise has led to the arrest of thousands of local criminals.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a full time position with a competitive benefits package and paid time off. Operators must be able to work all shifts, including day, swing and grave. Mandatory overtime may be required.

          Lindemann Chimney, Chicagoland's premier chimney service and a multi-state chimney supply company, is looking for a strong addition to help lead our accounting department. Our revenues are growing at over 30% per year and we need great people. We offer a great culture and competitive benefits.

          JOB DESCRIPTION:
          <br/>
          Were looking for people who work hard, communicate well and are committed to positive social change. Depending on where you work the hours of the job are from 1:45pm to 10pm Monday thru Friday, or 9am to 5pm Tuesday thru Saturday. Many of our staff also participate in campaign projects and attend workshops and trainings.
         </p>
         <p>
          The heart of the job is canvassing neighborhoods. That means were either going door-to-door or out to busy public places to talk with as many people as possible about the campaign. We identify people who support the issue and get them involved. Every day, each one of our staff talk to about forty people, sign up five new members and raise between $150-$250 for the campaign. Additionally, we do petitioning, media work, and coalition building, which also helps us win the campaign.
         </p>
         <p>
          PAY: Therefore, the average hourly wage is $9-$15/hr and the typical weekly pay is about $400-$600. can also earn more if you are in a leadership position.
         </p>
         <p>
          TRAINING:
          <br/>
          Canvassing is pretty basic, and you get better and better at it as you improve your skills and learn more about the issues. Training starts the first day, and it continues throughout your time on staff. Before you start on staff, there will be an observation day where you shadow one of our trainers to learn the basic skills. After that youll be able to attend workshops on canvassing, campaign and leadership skills, go to regional events and trainings, and have weekly meetings with the directors.
         </p>
         <p>
          LEADERSHIP:
          <br/>
          We offer the best candidates the opportunity to be a Field Manager in Training. Field Managers are some of the most important people for the campaign. In addition to canvassing each day, the Field Manager is responsible for motivating staff to hit goals in a particular town or site. They train most of the staff and take part in weekly staff meetings. They are the leadership team and play an even larger role in having an impact on these issues. These positions involve more hours and more responsibility. Field Managers can earn more in their pay or anywhere from $13-$15/hr.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are graduating this year, or have already graduated, we also have career opportunities all across the country running these types of campaigns. Youll run one of our canvass offices, recruiting and hiring your staff, training and managing them to win our campaigns, and handling the day-to-day operation of a campaign. Please let me know if you are interested in doing this type of work long-term

          JOB DESCRIPTION
          <br/>
          In keeping with the entrepreneurial ethos of our client, each of their departments operates in many ways like an independent business. For example, each of the three most secure and mission-critical business areas has an advanced, innovative technology sub-department that develops and operates numerous platforms and applications for the department. Due to these unique technical environments and the mission-criticality of their assets, each of these departments requires an embedded, dedicated security function that leverages and builds on the work done centrally by the Security Department.

This is truly both a security strategy/risk management role and a "hands on" technical security oversight role. It involves both engaging deeply with the departments to safeguard its critical assets, as well as helping shape the company-wide effort to transform how we do technology and security holistically. This position reports to the Head of Security for the department who is holistically responsible for securing the department.
